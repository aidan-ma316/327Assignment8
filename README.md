# IoT | Traffic System Simulator

#### Aidan Mara and Alvin Jin

## Vision


Our goal with this project was to get a better understanding of how, real-time data, specifically in the realm of IoT, is processed and used in a server and client interaction.

## What is it?

This project utilized a randomly generated IoT system which fed traffic data set at specific coordinates to a MongoDB database in real time. 
Our server would listen for TCP connections over the internet, and once prompted, would perform calculations on the most recent documents in the database to generate suggestions and rankings of the least busy highways to take.

## What did we learn?

We learned a lot with this project, specifically with how data in an IoT system is gathered and processed.

The networking aspect of the project was also really helpful in our understanding of how systems like this work when deployed.

## How to run it

Unfortunately, due to financial constraints we weren't able to keep the databases up, however the code is very readible and easy to understand. Included comments as well.

**Thanks for checking out our IoT program**
